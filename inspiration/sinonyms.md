# Belly

- shockingly distended belly
- taut straining mound
- huge round abdomen
- outstretched tummy
- full round expanse of her belly mound
- distended abdomen
- the vast, ripe boulder of her straining abdomen
- heavily parturient figure
- the extreme roundness of her tummy
- outstanding bowl of her belly
- belly so extremely swollen and thrust out before her
- enormous mound
- the huge curves of her swollen womb
- straining uterus
- tightly stretched tummy
- great globe of your belly
- how thin and tense was the sheet of enormously stretched abdominal skin
- the thinly drawn skin around her down tilted belly button
- overripe belly
- straining milkt white globe
- bulging womb
- great shiny taut belly
- your huge belly now hung, tightly defined, from your back, heavily curved from the weight it suspended

# Walking

- belly swaying ponderously from side to side
- heavily and awkwardly walking
- you lumbered carefully you back bent to balance your huge 
- huge belly swaying awkwardly with each waddling step

# Contraction

- Like a sheet of burning pain her abdominal muscles clamped and fisted tight around her baby burden
- tightly stretched tummy muscles
- clutching the side of your huge 
- firmness and tension of your overstretched muscular walls
- tightening of your uterus
- your back is suddenly aflame
- a searing band of pan flaring around the widest part of your outstretched tummy
- the white hot ring of fire tightening around your uterus
- your fingers ran over the aching sheet of muscle clasping your womb feeling how firm and tight it became over the bony limbs of your child
