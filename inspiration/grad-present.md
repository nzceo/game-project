Hayley was one of the most accomplished girls at her school. She was 
tall and slim with a ready smile and long auburn hair. As well as being 
graceful and athletic, captain of the school tennis team and a strong 
swimmer, she was intelligent and regularly topped her year in English and 
History. Hayley also got horny just like any other bright and healthy teenage 
girl, particularly midway between her periods when her young ovaries were 
readying her monthly egg.
Although all the boys had the hots for Hayley, she was firmly in 
love with her boyfriend Hal. On a saturday night they would drive up to the 
secluded spot in the hills where all the teenagers went to make out. There, in 
the car, they would smooch and nibble and tongue and he would stroke her 
firm, high breasts beneath her top, making her nipples hard and aching and 
her panties hot and damp. Hayley was a careful, responsible girl and felt 
very safe because Hal’s car was a sweet little Audi with separate front seats 
and a console and gear change between them. But one day, at the time of the 
month when her frustratioon peaked, her clamouring body needed more and, 
lifting her short skirt she climbed over the console and straddled Hal’s legs.
The first month she just enjoyed the rubbing of Hal’s jean-covered 
bulge on her panty-clad mons. When it happened again the next month she 
freed his long, hot rod and rubbed her wet panty crotch up and down its 
length until he shot up under her top. She felt so deliciously bad with his 
hot, slimy jism splattered all over her narrow tummy.
Thus, on the third month when the urges peaked again, she tugged 
her panties aside and frotted her puffy, sparsely-haired labia directly on his 
throbbing erection and was rewarded with her first real orgasm: shuddering 
and squeaking she lost control of her panty gusset, his thrusting rod snagged 
in the sopping lace and he spat the full load of his swollen balls onto the 
inside of her silky underwear. As she slumped, stunned and sated, thick 
rivulets of teeming goo oozed down off her panties into the excited, slightly 
parted lips of her vulva.
The relief of her needs kept her safe from temptation for a time but, 
sure enough, about a month later they were back at the spot and she was 
writhing on his naked organ once more.

“Oh God, I love you Hayley,” he moaned, “I want to marry you and 
give you children.”
“Oh Hal,” she gasped, “I want that more than anything and she 
reached up to hold his darling face while she kissed him and completely 
forgot about the thick, hard penis she was rubbing against. But the thick, 
hard penis had a mind of its own and, untended, it soon had its head lodged 
in the narrow channel where Hayley put her tampons. Her eyes went wide 
and she cried out. She squirmed and wriggled and bucked and succeeded 
only in jabbing Hal’s sharp pole all the way through her delicate hymen and 
down her vagina for the first time. After that she couldn’t clear her head 
until Hal had filled her tummy with semen.
She missed her next period.
Both sets of parents were most upset at the news but, after Hal and 
Hayley had explained how in love they were and that they wanted to marry, 
they calmed down and it was agreed that after the pair had graduated and 
the baby had come, they could think about a wedding.
The school principal was taken aback but, Hayley’s wasn’t the only 
teen pregnancy and she was glad to see that Hayley intended to continue 
with her education; and everyone could see that Hal and Hayley made a 
good pair. And while Hayley made a somewhat controversial role model, 
she was so superior in attainments to her peers that she was even chosen to 
present the address at the graduation ceremony.
The ceremony was set for a date exactly 31 weeks after losing her 
hymen in the car, which counted as 33 weeks since her previous period. She 
would be nearing eight months pregnant. Hayley didn’t mention to anyone 
that she couldn’t exactly remember actually having that period.
On the day of the ceremony Hayley dressed proudly in her 
graduation frock. It was a silky green, high waisted under her somewhat 
fuller breasts with a plunging neckline to take advantage of her cleavage. It 
was close fitting around her big, swollen tummy and then fell sweeping to 
her ankles. 
Hayley had carried small through her pregnancy but, in recent 
weeks, she had become conscious of a greatly increasing sense of tightness 
and weight in her belly. When her infant moved she could now see bumps 
on her taut abdomen as its limbs pressed against her. 
She remained fit and active. She had played competitive tennis until 
the middle of her term when her tummy began to press through her skimpy 
tennis frock and her opponents began to complain that they couldn’t play 
properly for fear of giving her a miscarriage. Now, in the neighbouring park 
where she went to have pictures taken in her new dress, her high spirits and 
the fine weather combined to send her gambolling about like the innocent 
young teenaged girl she really still was.
She was puffing and giggling as they returned to the house, but she 
was also aware of a surprising pressure that she was suddenly feeling deep 
within her pelvis. She rubbed her belly thoughtfully over lunch. It was very 
tight and seemed to be hanging partic

ularly low between her thighs. Her

muscles felt tense and stressed. “Too much bouncing around,” she thought 
to herself, “I guess my tummy muscles get tired more easily now.”
Hayley had a seat in the front row of the hall. After introductions 
and a speech from the Principal it was finally her big moment. She levered 
herself out of the seat and clambered to the stage, aware of all eyes on her. 
A murmur of comment went around the room. Some of the parents, at any 
rate, may not have realised quite how very pregnant she was. She forced 
herself to a careful measured walk, not showing the effort needed to carry 
her heavily gravid frame and stood at the slender lectern, her thighs parted 
enough beneath the long green dress to ease the pressure she was feeling.
The audience saw a beautiful young girl. Shining auburn hair hung 
straight to below her shoulders framing a face still slender but a little softer 
and plumper than before, her limbs still slim and muscular. The bulge of her 
plump, pert breasts against the bodice of her dress allowed those at the front 
to detect the outline of her much enlarged maternal nipples, somewhat 
incongruous on such a fresh-faced youngster, but otherwise only the full, 
round belly showed the changes about to come in her life.
She stood, head held high and proud. Her proud voice rang out 
through the hall, a picture of brave, confident womanhood. Her hands were 
at first clasped beneath her great belly then, involuntarily it seemed, strayed 
upwards, holding the dress close around the ripe, out-thrust globe. A hand 
either side surreptitiously stroked her gravid womb.
Then the measured flow of her speech stumbled slightly. Her brow 
wrinkled a little. Quickly she picked up the thread but then, a few words 
later, strain came into her voice, the flow of the speech faltered. Her face 
began to flush and she tried to continue, taking deep breaths and stuttering 
over her words. Suddenly she stopped, a stricken expression on her 
beautiful young face. Silence gripped the hall. She gave a painful gasp.
Her hands were now grasping her belly, fingers digging into the taut 
surface. Those close to the stage could see the great swollen globe seem to 
flex and push out beneath the green dress.
At first drips began to fall between her legs; then little dribbles 
appeared, flowing down her legs, pooling at her shoes; then a stream of 
liquid began to patter onto the stage between her parted feet.
She moaned and bent forward, clutching at the lectern with one 
hand while the other curled around her hard, round belly. A great wet stain 
was spreading rapidly down the front of the silken green dress.
“OoohhhWWW!” she suddenly cried, high and frightened, the 
microphone sending it bouncing harshly around the hall, and fluid was 
cascading out of her, splattering and splashing onto the stage and spreading 
out in a big pool around her before the astonished gaze of parents, children 
and teachers.
Hayley gasped and fought for breath, her long silky hair fell 
forward about a face crimson with shock and embarrassment. She grasped 
hold of the lectern and stood upright again, sweat glistening on her brow, 
her lips trembling. Everyone was still too surprised to move. She took a

deep, shuddering breath and gave a beseeching look to her loved ones, 
gazing horrified from the audience.
“Ooohhh!! ...” she said. “OOOOOOHHHH!!! ...” and she doubled 
over with a long, heartrending moan, hands clenched in the ruined fabric of 
her dress, as there, before the assembled throng at the proudest moment of 
her young life, her uterus tightened to a violent sheet of flame in the first of 
many hard, searing contractions.
By now the Principal had leapt into action and the stricken girl was 
hustled, sobbing and panting, from the stage. An ambulance was summoned 
but the modest size of her slightly early baby and the strength of her fit 
young muscles meant that the dark curly hair of her offspring was already 
visible between her white, straining thighs by the time the paramedics got 
there; and so his first son squirted out into Hal’s trembling hands in the 
crowded confines of the school sick bay. He may have missed most of the 
ceremony but Hal reckoned that nobody got a better graduation present that 
day than Hayley and him!
