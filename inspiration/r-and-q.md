April Danner bent awkwardly over, tugging her nightdress, her very 
voluminous nightdress, clear of her head and picking up, in the same 
economical movement her full cupped brassiere. As a mature mother, her 
latest pregnancy, so surprising to her colleagues and friends, had brought a 
return to lactation as it reached its final stage, her mammary glands 
recovering the function they had held in her younger days of motherhood, 
and accordingly she required padded maternity cups to absorb any 
embarrassing leaks. She passed her arms through the wide shoulder straps 
and straightened with a slight huff of effort, tugging the cups down to 
capture the plump drooping mounds of her swollen chest, then biting her lip 
as she lifted and stretched, up and back, to support and secure herself in the 
soft shapely garment. With firm high maternity panties already tightly 
cupping her great straining tummy, she waddled heavily to the wardrobe and 
selected a dark blue dress, meant to discretely accommodate the growing 
figure of the pregnant executive but, in the case of the almost due older 
mother, stretching tautly and revealingly over her very gravid body.
The hot and tiring work of rolling that dress over her mammary and 
uterine swelling at last done, April hastened uncomfortably downstairs to 
where her daughter was already preparing breakfast. As she approached she 
heard her daughter give a sudden gasp and grip the kitchen bench with 
clenched, widespread hands.
“Paige, darling, is everything alright?” asked April anxiously.
“I don’t know mummy,” replied the teen fearfully turning towards 
her mother. She was wearing a green sleeveless knitted top over full braless 
breasts whose nipples were visibly raised beneath the fabric, but April’s 
concerned mother’s eyes were only on the great globe of her daughter’s 
heavily pregnant abdomen, stretching the green top to its limit, and which 
was surely pressing lower than it had even the evening before.
That mother and daughter should face each other that morning with 
equally distended abdomens arose from the shameful fact that both had been 
impregnated by the same rampant penis on the same night 39 weeks before.
Paige had persuaded her reluctant mother to allow her latest 
boyfriend Tristan to spend the night. It was late and April was only just 
home from a tiring day at the office.
“”Wouldn’t you rather we were here where you can keep an eye on 
us than spending the night out?” wheedled Paige cunningly.
“Well all right, young lady,” replied April distractedly, noting not 
for the first time how alluring her slender young daughter was becoming, 
“But separate rooms OK. You can make up the spare room for Tristan.”
“Oh Mom!” pouted the teen. But she went to the linen cupboard 
anyway.
April had grave misgivings for Tristan was a stunning, brooding, 
dark-haired boy whose smouldering gaze left not even forty year old April 
unaffected. Furthermore he had a reputation for being a heartbreaker who 
had bedded every just about female in the school (including some teachers) 
and April had no doubt that Paige was heading for disillusion.

“Men!” she sighed to herself. “Who needs them!” But the truth was 
that she was not altogether immune to Tristan’s attractions herself.
It was fifteen years since Paige’s father had left her for a younger 
woman and for most of that time she had not regretted putting aside the 
complications of a man in her life for the satisfying achievements of her 
career, but every now and then...
Shortly after dinner she told her daughter that she was heading for 
bed early, deciding that leaving the living room to the teens was better than 
encouraging them to go to Paige’s bedroom. “I know I can trust you alone 
with him, sweetheart,” she murmured, “Just remember: rewards and 
consequences, OK?”
In bed she read a report she had brought home from the office for a 
short time then put out the light, determined not to worry about what the 
youngsters were up to.
She awoke at an unknown hour in the night. She had been dreaming 
a disturbing libidinous fantasy of being taken, vigorously by a man whose 
face she could never quite see. She was aroused, her nipples urgent and 
without thinking her hand probed between her legs to soothe the throbbing 
itch there. Then she became aware of the probable cause of her disquiet. 
From the bedroom next door came a rhythmic creak and squeak of the bed, 
getting subtly louder and quicker, and then audible gasps in rhythm with the 
movements that sounded like Paige. April’s mind was in a whirl. Was Paige 
‘amusing’ herself, as April felt every inclination to do? Or had Tristan 
sneaked into her daughter’s bed against her express instruction?
The sounds continued. April got up and padded to Paige’s bedroom 
door. Again she paused. Quietly she opened the door. She gasped. The teens 
were on the bed. Paige’s moaning body was thrusting upwards, her legs 
wrapped around the midriff of her lover, whose big, hard curved, weapon 
was pistoning furiously in and out of her tight young slit.
The musky smell of sex was strong, Paige’s copious juices glistened 
on her ravisher’s organ as it scythed in and out, back and forward. Paige 
turned her head and saw her mother standing there. At the same instant 
Tristan spotted her.
“Ohh fuck!” he bellowed. “OOooohhhh God, Yeeeessss!”
He drove hard and deep into Paige and stayed there. In the subdued 
light from the window April saw his balls tighten and pulse.
Suddenly Paige was shouting: “Shit. Shit. You came in me! Christ. 
Get off me! You promised! Shit!”
“OOhh babe“ groaned Tristan pulling his rampant dick out of Paige 
with an audible squelch. “That was fucking good! And in front of your Mom 
too!” he added with a leer. “Hope you enjoyed the show Misses.”
“Mom!” cried Paige. “Were you watching! Oh god this is so fucked 
up!”
“You! Get out of that bed this instant!” spat April.
“OK,” said Tristan, climbing to his feet. “And do what? Maybe you 
want some of this for yourself? You know you’re not too bad looking for an

older babe.”
“Were you watching?” repeated Paige, increasing hysteria in her 
voice. “Oh God you evil bitch. You distracted him and made him come in 
me!”
“That’s right,” snarled Tristan. “it’s her fault. I reckon she’s hot for 
it. She’s jealous you know?” He advanced menacingly towards her.
“Mom?” gasped Paige.
“Get away from me!” cried April, backing nervously to the wall, her 
heart pounding.
“Oh she wants it all right!” drawled Tristan, “Look at those 
nipples!”
And it was true. April was gasping for breath, her chest heaving 
beneath the her expensive silken nightgown thrusting rigid nipples starkly 
against the fabric in the shadowed light of the room. Her eyes seemed 
mesmerised by the long, partially stiff penis of the beautiful naked boy 
walking towards her.
“No, stay off me!” she pleaded, her voice cracking with panic.
“What do you reckon? Should I tame the bitch?” he tossed over his 
shoulder to the bed where Paige was still breathing hard from her own 
mating.
“Paige ...” April pleaded.
“Yeah. Give the sleazy bitch what she deserves,” wailed Paige 
hysterically.
“Nooooooo!” April moaned but Tristan backed her against the wall 
and ran exploring hands down her body. “Still pretty good I reckon,” he 
said, lifting the hem of her nightgown up to her hips and thrusting his hand 
into her thick curly thatch.
April moaned incoherently, but her body was beginning to betray 
her. Already somewhat aroused when she entered the room, the threat from 
the rampant, virile man, the sight of his organ, which was rising to full 
stiffness again as he fondled her charms, and even the sight of his thick 
cream running slowly out between her daughter’s still well spread legs was 
reaching subliminally to nipple and clitoris and vagina. She was about to be 
raped and her body, not mated now for many years, was primed and ready.
He took her standing there, pressed up against the wall, sliding 
easily in her wet, 40 year old maternal pussy. She didn’t climax but she 
couldn’t prevent the wanton thrusting of her hips as he arrogantly pleasured 
her in front of her astonished daughter. 
For the second time he drove deep and hard. He was long and April 
could feel him somewhere up around her cervix. For the second time he 
unloaded three, four, five, six big spurts into a Danner family vagina. He 
pulled free, wiped himself on her nightgown, grabbed his clothes and was 
gone, leaving April collapsed on the floor in shame and humiliation.
She knew she was at her fertile time, as she knew her daughter 
really wasn’t, “But at least he has already dropped a big load,” she reassured 
herself, “Won’t have enough left to tag a tough 40 year old egg in one go.”

They didn’t speak of that night, mother and daughter. So far as 
April knew Paige never saw Tristan again. “So at least some good came of 
it,” she told herself.
Both put the events determinedly out of their minds as their lives 
moved on. April gave no thought to the increasing irregularity of her 
periods, or maybe it was that they had gone for good? She gave no thought 
to it a month or two later when she and Paige were a little off colour. She 
gave no thought to the funny look Paige gave her when she commented that 
she was getting a little old for her ‘little black dress’, “it shows my tummy 
too much. At my age I’m not as firm as I used to be!” She gave no thought 
to the increasing tightness and discomfort of her brassieres or the extra 
inches she was putting on at her waistline.
Finally one day at work April noticed her secretary eyeing her 
appraisingly.
“What?”
“Do you mind ... I thought you might say something, but I’ve been 
dying to ask .... When are you due?”
April turned crimson with embarrassment, mumbled something 
incomprehensible and, at the first opportunity, raced to the bathroom. There 
she took off her jacket, sucked her tummy in to release her skirt where it 
strained on the last available button, lifted her new, larger-size designer 
blouse, and gazed in the mirror. She realised with horror that she was 
looking at a flowering four, or could it be ... no it must be: nearly five month 
belly!
Her head was in a whirl as she came home and immediately sought 
out her daughter.
“Paige, I’ve got some rather shocking news,” she blurted. “I’m 
pregnant!”
Her daughter’s face crumpled in tears. “Oh my god, I didn’t know 
how to tell you,” she sobbed. And tugged up the baggy sweatshirt she was 
wearing to show her horrified mother a still small, but nevertheless clearly 
defined pot in her once flat tummy. 
“Oh Paige darling, how long ... I mean when ...” 
“That night,” said the young girl in sepulchral tones. “It must have 
been.”
“Snap,” said April succinctly. “The bastard!”
“Oh mommy, I’m scared. I’m too young to have a baby,” wailed 
Paige, throwing herself into her mother’s arms.
“It’s too late now,” replied her mother grimly. “Rewards and 
consequences remember. We’re two thoroughly knocked up women and the 
babies are coming whether we like it or not. But I’ll always be here for you 
my sweetheart.”
pril waddled anxiously to her daughter’s side. She rolled up the green Atop baring the young girl’s big, taut belly above a hip hugging skirt

which April noted with concern remained undone at the very top button 
where Paige’s steeply swelling uterus pushed deeply down. Paige’s 
abdomen had remained thankfully compact even into her eighth month, but 
over the last weeks it had pressed aggressively out becoming huge and tight. 
Paige was otherwise a slender child and the awful size of her distended 
uterus was therefore even more shocking to the eye in comparison.
April ran her hands over her daughter’s big, hard tummy. She could 
feel plainly the lusty limbs of her grandchild beneath the thinly stretched 
sheet of muscle covering it. The skin felt tense and hot to touch, as if Paige’s 
muscles were already working vigorously beneath the surface of her tummy. 
“Oh Mommy!” Paige gulped, “I’m scared. What’s happening to 
me?”
April quickly revised the calculation. Based on their last periods, 
Paige was due a little after her mother but, since they were impregnated in 
the same hour they should presumably both be due at April’s date, which 
was a week away at present.
“Don’t be frightened, sweetheart” she said. “It’s just your body 
getting ready for the birth, but you need to avoid stress so that you don’t 
bring labour on early.” Paige was in the process of completing her 
graduation exams. “I’ll phone and tell them that you can’t make the exam. 
I’ll take the day off and we’ll go into town and see the doctor.” And she 
hugged Paige into an embrace. “Don’t worry, I’m here for you.”
The two women clung together awkwardly. As their tummies had 
ripened they had learned to twist so that their bellies were side to side as 
they leaned over them to comfort one another. In these final days of their 
gestation, their babes were so tightly packed into maternal wombs that it 
seemed they could sense each other through thin walls of muscle thus 
pressed together and they squirmed in mutual recognition. Each felt her 
anxiety melt away to be replaced by the deep contentment known only by a 
woman who feels her offspring moving eagerly within her.
“I’m here for you my sweetheart,” April murmured.
As April made phone calls, Paige continued to get breakfast. She so 
wanted to trust her mother that she determinedly ignored the painful, heavy 
cramp when it returned to her. She clung to the kitchen bench and took deep 
surreptitious breaths so that her mother would not hear her. “These pains are 
not that bad,” she told herself, “Not like labour is supposed to be.”
But during breakfast there was nowhere to hide when the renewed 
constriction in her tummy brought a sudden gasp. 
“Paige?” exclaimed her mother, looking up sharply. And Paige 
could only nod miserably.
April sucked in a deep breath, levered herself out of her chair and 
lumbered carefully around the table to her stricken daughter. She bent 
quickly, and then immediately regretted it as her swollen tummy seemed to 
tighten and she felt sudden pressure low in her pelvis. She stroked her 
daughter’s lower abdomen. It felt hot and hard. She wished that she knew 
how to push her fingers up her daughter’s delicate vagina and test her cervix

to tell whether she was going into labour.
“How does it feel, sweetheart?” she asked.
“It’s quite sore, mommy,” the young girl replied anxiously. “This is 
just those Braxton-Hicks thingeys, right?”
“Of course, darling,” her mother said reassuringly, “But we’ll get to 
the doctor just as soon as possible anyway.”
April clambered awkwardly back upstairs to the office. She needed 
to check her e-mail as she wasn’t going to work that day. Meanwhile Paige 
was in the kitchen washing up.
She had just grabbed a handful of dishes to dry when she felt the 
telltale cramping of her abdomen. “Here it comes again,” she thought. She 
sucked air as the cramp built and built. And then she felt the sharp stitch in 
her side. “Oooooffff!” she moaned in dismay, clutching her right hand to the 
side of her belly. And then she felt the big, red hot band of pain searing right 
across her poor swollen tummy. She dropped the plates with an almighty 
crash and hunched over, clinging to the bench top with one hand while she 
clutched at her convulsing belly with the other.
“Ohmigod! ... OOOhmigoood! ...” she wailed, “MOMMY!! ... 
MOMMEEEE!!”
April heard her daughter’s screaming from the kitchen. Her heart 
pounding, she threw herself to her feet and stumbled clumsily from the 
room.
“I’m coming ... I’m coming!” she shouted, her breath already 
coming in harsh pants as she waddled urgently down the stairs, each jarring 
step bouncing her heavy fetus painfully against her pelvis.
“Help me! ... Help me!” sobbed the hysterical teen and threw 
herself into her mother’s arms, their massive bellies colliding with a heavy 
smack.
“It’s all right, baby, it’s going to be all right,” April crooned 
distractedly, conscious of the furious thumping of her overwrought heart and 
the pain of the collision rolling over her own belly.
“Hhooooo! ... Hhooooo! ...” Paige panted, the tension draining from 
her. “Feeling better ....Hhooooo! ... Hhooooo! ...”
“Just sit here for a moment while I clean this up, and then we’re 
definitely off to the doctor.”
April bent painfully to clear up the shards of crockery. Her tummy 
was still tender and in this position she felt so much pressure. So much 
pressure that she suddenly needed to straighten quite badly. 
“I can get the rest later,” she puffed. “Now, purse and car keys. 
Purse and ... Ooohhh! ...”
She suddenly stiffened and clutched her back.
Paige, who was feeling weakened but more comfortable again, 
watched uncomprehendingly as her mother’s face tightened in alarm, the 
older woman’s eyes focussed on her enormous belly where it strained 
against the blue fabric of her expensive maternity dress. Her hands pressed 
hard into her back and her tummy pushed forward, hard and round. Then she

gasped harshly and her face screwed up with pain.
“OOOhhhhhh!! ...” she moaned, “... HHnnngggghgh ...”
“Mommy, what’s wrong!” 
“A moment ... OOOhhhhhh!! ... HHaaaahhhhh!! ... Just a moment! 
...” April fumbled behind her for support from the kitchen bench and rubbed 
her other hand in soothing circular motions over her cramping belly.
“Oh mommy, you can’t be! ... Please don’t say ..”
“Oh Paige ... darling ... Got to get to the toilet ... leaking,” April 
gasped.
“Mommy, let me help,” Paige cried, climbing to her feet and 
grasping her mother’s shoulder for support. She was shocked to feel how 
tense and shaking her mother was.
Together they stumbled into the downstairs bathroom, April, for her 
daughter’s sake, trying not to moan at the sharp pain still gripping her belly. 
She could feel liquid running out of her, drenching her panties and 
beginning to trickle down her thighs.
She bent to lift her dress as they reached the toilet and cried out as 
the pain intensified.
“Paige! Ring for an ambulance quickly!” she gasped.
Paige waddled quickly to the hall phone and returned to the 
bathroom to see her mother seated on the toilet, back arched and belly, the 
blue dress rolled high, stretched far out between her widespread thighs. Her 
mother’s face was screwed up, her mouth wide open and she moaned 
urgently, her hands clawing at the taut bulk of her abdomen.
Suddenly a great gush of fluid spewed out from the profuse thatch 
at the base of her belly and cascaded into the toilet.
“Ohmigod! Mommeeeee!! ... Your waters ... You broke your 
waters! ... Ohmigod! ... Ohmigod!” babbled the panicking teen and she 
stumbled against the wall and sent the phone flying in a graceful arc, down 
between her mother’s open thighs and into the toilet bowl with a great 
splash.
The discharge of her waters had eased the pressure in April's womb 
and she was now recovering from her sustained contraction. She gazed 
silently up at Paige. Both knew what this meant: their house, in its little 
development beyond the outskirts of town, was out of mobile phone range 
and so they had just lost their only means of communication with the outside 
world.
April reached awkwardly down between her legs and fished the 
phone out of her pungent birth fluids. She flicked a few buttons. Nope.
“Oh mommy,” gasped Paige, “ ... Mommeeeee!! ...”
A sense of panic came into her voice and she bent over clutching at 
her tummy. “... Ooohhh God! ... OOoohhh! ... OOoohhh! ...” and before her 
mother’s anxious gaze her legs buckled and she crumpled to her knees. 
“Help meeee!! ... “ she wailed.
“Breathe, breathe,” April urged, “Like I taught you: Hooooo! ... 
Hooooo! ... Hooooo! ...”

“HHoooooofff! ... HHoooooofff! ... Oh God it hurts! ... 
HHoooooofff! ... HHoooooofff! ... HHoooooofff! ...” panted the stricken 
teen.
April struggled to her feet and went to comfort her daughter. It was 
becoming clear that they needed urgently to get to some help.
While Paige recovered, April clambered painfully up the stairs once 
again to throw some things in a bag for the two of them. She was very 
conscious of her unborn child low in her pelvis, its head pushing into the 
ring of bone which had been widened by Paige’s passing through it all those 
years before.
As she threw clothes into a bag and changed into something more 
suited to delivering a child than the tight blue dress, she heard Paige seized 
with another contraction:
“HHoooooofff! ... HHoooooofff! ... Haaaaaaahhhhh! ...” Paige’s 
moans echoed through the house. And then: “ ... Hhnnnnnghggh!! ...”
“Paige,” she called in alarm, “You’re not pushing, sweetheart? You 
mustn’t push yet!”
“HHoooooofff! ... Haaaaaaaaahhhhh!! ... Trying ... Hurts so much ... 
OOhhhh! ... Hhnnnnnghggh!! ...”
“Don’t push sweety, breath! Breathe!” cried her worried mother, 
grunting softly with pain as she waddled as quickly as possible back down 
the stairs. The bag, with the merest necessities in it, was like a lead weight 
in her arms as she held it across the top of her tautly swollen abdomen. Her 
daughter was seated on a kitchen chair, leaning forward, her legs well 
spread, her face flushed with effort.
“Hhhhaaahhhhh! ... Hhhhaaahhhhh! ...” she panted obediently, the 
worst of her contraction apparently past.
“Oh Paige, darling. Don’t worry, we’ll get you to doctor just as 
soon as possible,” said April
Paige looked up, her tear streaked face catching at April’s heart 
strings. “Oh mommy,” she pleaded, running her hands protectively over her 
huge, low hanging belly, its hard, stretched underside now exposed below 
the tight green top. “It hurts so badly. Does it get worse than this? I need 
something for the pain.”
“You just can’t think about the pain,” said April gently. “Not until 
we get to the doctor. Then he will give you something to take it away.”
Paige bit her lip in consternation, then seemed to notice what her 
mother was wearing for the first time.
April had removed her tightly constraining dress and brassiere and 
now wore a long loose skirt fastened under her jutting uterus and a white t-
shirt which, although the baggiest she owned, nonetheless, in her present 
state, clung tightly to her gravid body. For the first time Paige could see just 
how full and weighty her mother’s breasts had become, slumping heavily 
onto the shelf of her outstretched womb, their thick, stiff, slightly down-
pointing nipples poking out almost an inch long and half that across against 
the thinly stretched fabric, through which their deep chocolate colour and

that of April’s broad areolae could be clearly distinguished from the 
surrounding flesh.
Paige’s own top was now sweat-dampened from her exertions and 
clung revealingly to her tense, plump but still high breasts and their long 
erect nipples but, oblivious of her appearance she gasped: “Mother! You 
can’t go out looking like that!”
“Darling,” April replied reprovingly, “We are about to spread our 
legs wide open and stretch our vaginas to the limit in front of assorted 
doctors and nurses. There’s no point in worrying about our appearance 
where we’re going!”
“Oh Mommy ..” wailed the teen, but no answer came from her 
mother.
April stretched her back and walked gingerly to the table. She 
sucked in a deep breath, determined not to further frighten her distraught 
daughter, but there was, deep within her, an urgency which could not be 
denied. She placed both hands flat on the table. She felt her great, swollen 
belly flex ferociously and then her abdomen exploded in a sheet of flame. 
Sweat sprang up on her forehead and her mouth twisted and worked in silent 
agony.
“Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ...” she panted 
hoarsely.
The downward pressure on her bones was immense and she shifted 
her feet reflexively, in desperate, instinctive need to work her child’s into 
the best position to pass through her.
“Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ...Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ...”
If Paige’s contractions were coming faster and more often, her 
mother’s were longer and she could do nothing but endure, aware of her 
daughter’s growing terror.
“Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... Hhoohhhhhhh!! ... Hhoohhhh!! ... 
Hhhfffff! ...” she panted, allowing her body to slump, drained as her uterus 
relented.
“Oh mommy,” whispered Paige. “What are we to do?”
“Drive,” April replied implacably.
he two women waddled painfully to the vehicle waiting in the drive, 
barely noticing the first drop of rain beginning to fall. They clung to 
each other for support, their wombs clasped firmly together so that their 
babies sat, elbow to elbow, side by side, heads burrowed in their mother’s 
pelvises, separated only by two rippling, tightening uterine walls. Paige was 
whimpering with pain as April helped to ease her into the passenger seat and 
swing her slender legs into the foot well. Gathering up her skirts and 
grimacing at the intense discomfort the older woman then squeezed her own 
enormous belly into the driver’s seat, set as far back as possible.
Fighting to ignore the gathering pressure in her bottom April 
reversed the car jerkily down the drive and bounced over the curb onto the 
road.

“Mommeeeeee! ...” screamed Paige in agony. Her hands tugged up 
the green top and clutched at her tight, protruding tummy.
“AAAaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiieeeeee!! ...” she howled, her sweet young face 
contorted in agony. “HHhhhooooo ... HHhhhooooo ... 
AAAaaaaaaaiiiiiiiiieeeeee!! ...” and from between her straining thighs burst 
a fierce stream of fluid raining down into a swiftly growing puddle at her 
feet.
“Ohhh Mommeeee! ... Ohh God it hurts!!” she sobbed, “I can’t do it 
... I just can’t ... it’s not fair!”
“You can do it Paige Danner,” replied her mother fiercely, 
struggling to keep the vehicle on the road as the awful cramping sensation 
built up around her own pelvis. “You have to do it. There are rewards and 
there are consequences, remember!”
“It’s all your fault!” Paige bawled hysterically, “He never would 
have come in me if you hadn’t been watching. What kind of deviant mom 
watches her daughter getting screwed?”
“I wasn’t watching!” shouted April hotly, “And who spread her 
slutty legs in the first place!”
“Hoooo! ... Hoooo! ...” Paige was sobbing and gasping with pain at 
the same time.
“... And who urged him on to rape me!” April was starting to lose it, 
“... Your own mother! ... I’m too old for this! ... AAAaaarrrrrrgggghhh!!! 
...”
April’s eyes closed over and she just had the presence of mind to 
bring them to a halt in the middle of the road as a white hot band of pain 
gripped the great ball of her belly. She rucked up her skirt, baring an even 
bigger belly than her daughter’s in the seat alongside, and hunched over the 
steering wheel, legs spread.
Paige realised with a shock that her mother was wearing no panties. 
Between her parted thighs meaty maternal labia poked out, inflamed and 
swollen, from her wide, thick bush.
“Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ...” April ground out, 
willing herself not to push against the desperate urgency gripping her pelvic 
floor. “HHHNNgggggggghhhh!! ... Ooohhhhhh ... Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... 
Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... HhhnnggggggGGHHhh!! ...” she groaned as the 
battle was lost and, gripping the steering wheel for leverage, she relieved her 
pressure in the only way possible, by pushing: tightening up her abdominal 
muscles and thrusting her baby down until her 40 year old pelvis creaked 
and gave, sending pain stabbing through her.
Her face was screwed up and purple with effort and her chin 
pressed down onto her chest. Sweat was running in rivers down her neck 
and soaking into her t-shirt. And still the intense contraction gripped her.
“Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ... Hooooooofff! ... Hooooooofff! ... 
Hhhaaaaarrggghhh!! ...” she roared, squirming uncomfortably, her body 
instinctively trying to free the bulky fetal head lodged in her bony gap.
“Ooooohhh Paige!! ... Hooooooofff! ... Hooooooofff! ... Oooohh

darling I’m sorry! ... Hooooooofff! ... Hooooooofff! ... We’ll get through 
this sweetheart!”
Paige was crying softly, her labouring in remission for the moment. 
Her mother was so strong and brave and she needed her so much. “I know 
we will, Mommy,” she whispered. “I love you.”
The rain was coming down more strongly now. As soon as April 
had recovered from her latest ordeal she fumbled a shaking foot onto the 
accelerator pedal and set them in motion once again. There was no traffic at 
this time of day up here but if they could only get down to the main road 
there might be people and aid. She no longer had confidence that she could 
drive them all the way to the doctor.
Paige was beginning to breath harder again. “Ohh Mommy,” she 
moaned, “I can feel it again! Oh God, Mommy ... Please ... Help Meeee!! ... 
HHooooo!! ... HHooooo!! ... AAaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!! ... 
HHNnnnnnngggghhh!! ...” and her young legs jacknifed up and out, 
colliding with the door and the steering wheel as she clutched her 
convulsing tummy in both hands.
April could tell that her daughter was in hard, pushing labour now, 
her face distressed and scarlet as she fought to bring her baby to birth. She 
wished that she knew whether Paige’s cervix was fully dilated but she could 
tell from the desperate working of Paige’s thighs that her poor daughter was 
being gripped by forces beyond her control.
“HHooooo!! ... HHooooo!! ... HHooooo!! ... HHNnnnnnngggghhh!! 
...”
April brought them to a halt once more. Paige was sagging back, 
gasping raggedly. “Ohhhh God, Mommy ... Hhhoooo ... Hhhoooo ... I can’t 
take any more ... Hhhoooo ... It’s too big, I can’t make it come!!”
“Here, sweetest,” she said, reaching over to the back seat and 
retrieving a blanket. “Turn this way and put this behind you.” 
She pushed the passenger seat back into a reclined position and 
helped her daughter, wincing with pain, to twist in the seat so that she faced 
April with her back against the door. In this position there was more room 
for Paige to spread her legs. “Lets get these off you,” she said, easing 
Paige’s sopping panties down her slim thighs. The skimpy, girlish panties 
seemed such a forlorn scrap of material in her hands, drenched as they were 
with her daughter’s birthing fluids and symbolising her rushed transition to 
adulthood. Her heart ached to see the sweet teenage vulva revealed by their 
removal, the short, sparse, silken hair framing Paige’s small, tightly furled 
slit, and to know that by the end of the day that organ would resemble her 
own stretched and large lipped entrance.
“Hhaahh! ... Hhaahh! ...”” Paige’s pains were already coming again. 
“HHhhnnnnggghh!!” she moaned and April could see her daughter’s tense 
abdomen tighten and bulge out, its sides sucked in by the strength of Paige’s 
desperate pushing.
“OOooowwwwoohh!! ...” she wailed, “Mommeee!! It HURTS!! ...”
Breathe, sweetie,” urged her mother, “HHoooohh! ... HHoooohh!

...”
“HHaaaahh!! ... HHaaaahh!! ...” gasped the distressed teen, 
“HHhhnnnnggghh!! ... HHaaaahh!! ... HHaaaahh!! ...”
“Keep breathing darling, I’ve got to get us to the doctor,” And April 
set them once again in cautious motion.
The rain was falling steadily now and the windows were fogging up 
from the intense panting of the two labouring women. April peered blearily 
forward and tried to ignore the pain gripping her pelvis.
“Oooohhh Mommeeee!! I need help ... NOW!!” screamed her 
daughter beside her. I can’t make it come! ... Mommeee!!”
“Oh God, Paige, No! ... Not now!! ... Noooooo!!” moaned her 
mother as the car veered alarmingly on the road. April tried so hard to keep 
their speed up but her legs were pushing apart under the unbearable pressure 
of her descending babe and her belly knotted up under an immense, gut 
wrenching contraction.
“AAAaaaarrrggghhhh!!! ...” her agonised scream echoed 
deafeningly in the narrow space as she wrapped her arms around the 
steering wheel and violently tugged it towards her, half lifting herself out of 
her seat her knees straining wide, pushing and pushing at the huge bulk of 
her fetus. Her pelvic bones gave with a loud crack and suddenly she had the 
full width of her baby’s head in her bony gap. Somehow in all of this she 
managed to keep them, albeit slowing, on the road.
“Mommmeeee??!! ...” shrieked her hysterical daughter.
“God ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ...” panted her mother, 
“I’m sorry my darling ...Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Can’t do it 
anymore ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... My baby’s coming ... Got 
to push! ... HHHnnnnnnnngggghghhh!!”
After that last heavy push she was close now, very close, and so she 
brought the vehicle shakily to the side of the road under the overhanging 
trees and switched the motor off.
Grunting frantically with effort she put her own seat back and 
twisted and squirmed until she faced her daughter belly to belly, their 
widespread legs almost touching.
“Breathe, darling ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... like me!” 
she gasped.
Paige gazed in wonder at her sight of her mother’s fattened thighs 
spread wide and high, stretching the generous, full-lipped vulva. Her great, 
round belly was heaving and rippling with muscular effort and, above, her 
thick brown nipples stood long and hard, clearly visible now through the t-
shirt made transparent by big round patches of moisture that Paige 
recognised with shock must be milk seeping from her mother’s heavy, 
swollen breasts.
Before her daughter’s shocked gaze, April’s lips stretched open, her 
gash assuming a tight teardrop shape. In the gap Paige could see gooey hair.
“Ohmigod ... OOhmigod ...” gasped the teen. “Whhhhooooo!! ... 
Whhhhooooo!! ... Mommy! I can see the head!” Then she banged her head

back with a painful thump on the door as her own agony spiked: 
“AAAoooooowwwww!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... 
AAAiiiieeeeeee!!!”
April knew that her daughter was at her wits end with pain and 
panic and desperately needed her mother’s comfort and support but her own 
crisis was now fully upon her. Grasping each leg just behind the knee, she 
stretched herself as wide as possible, lowered her chin to her heaving chest 
and bore down with all her might.
“HHHHhhhhnnnnnnggggghhhh!!! ...” she howled.
Her baby moved. Scraping pitilessly against her pelvic girdle the 
big bony head eased lower.
Her cries and those of her distressed daughter bounced crazily about 
the walls of the vehicle as she bent again to her urgent task.
“HHHHhhhhnnnnnnggggghhhh!!! ...” She felt the awful stinging of 
her baby’s head stretching her labia to the limit, as Paige’s had done so 
many years before. Gasping she slumped back, feeling the baby slide back 
into her, propelled by the tension in her violated pussy ring.
Paige was in shock at the awful sight of her mother’s intimate gash 
bulging uncontrollably outwards and stretching into a tortured, yawning O. 
And even more so at the impossible size of the cruel, curved boulder forcing 
its way out which her mother’s painfully stretched sex had no more than 
begun to accommodate. Her heart pounded with fear and her belly 
immediately contracted with more ferocity than ever before.
“HHaaaaaiiiiiiieeeeeeeeeee!!! ...” she bawled, “Whhhhooooo!! ... 
Whhhhooooo!! ... Mommeeee!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... I 
don’t want to die!! ...”
April knew a mother’s desperation to tend her terrified child and 
knew she must birth her own baby as quickly as possible. She knew that her 
ageing tissues needed time to adjust to the passing of a fully grown baby 
from her vagina but, in the face of her daughter’s need, she gritted her teeth 
and bore furiously down, ramming the great bowl of her baby’s cranium 
against the throbbing ring of her labia. She felt her vulva snap hard as a 
bowstring around the bony skull and fiery stinging pain shot through her. 
Yet this time she did not relax but, gritting her teeth, she kept shoving 
against the obstruction, shoving and shoving until something seemed to tear 
and the baby’s head popped out of her.
In the midst of her hard, cramping agony, Paige looked on in horror 
as her mother stretched and stretched, her once full, fleshy lips going paper 
thin and white as all the blood was squeezed from them. And then, just 
when it seemed that there could not possibly be room for the baby to 
emerge, the head slid forcefully out and lodged there, protruding from her 
mother’s bruised and bleeding vulva.
Her mother gasped convulsively, forcing air back into her lungs 
then, with heart-rending cries of pain, she leant forward, grasping her baby’s 
head, and began twisting and tugging at it. 
“Oh God ... Here I go ... Another one!” she cried as a contraction

rolled over her and she managed to dislodge a shoulder, sending the baby 
squirting out of her in a gush of fluid, tumbling across into the passenger 
seat to land between Paige’s astonished legs.
Paige looked tremulously into her mother’s sweat-streaked and 
haggard face.
“Whhhhooooo!! ... Whhhhooooo!! ... Mommy, you did it! ...” she 
managed to gasp.
“Oh Paige, darling,” her mother gulped, suppressing sobs of joy and 
relief as she leant across and lifted up her new-born child. It was a boy.
April flipped her t-shirt up and cradled her son to her belly. Her full, 
heavy breasts dangled low, pushing a dark teat, like a fat, ripe fruit, into the 
new-born’s face. From instinct the tiny wrinkled form opened his mouth and 
engulfed the long, thick nipple which was already dripping with pearls of 
life-giving milk.
April’s first born child was no longer noticing however, she was 
pushing and pushing, painfully and despairingly.
Still puffing with effort, April carefully put her baby aside into the 
back seat, still attached to the cord which twisted and spiralled from her 
gaping vagina and turned her attention to the frightened, labouring teen.
“OOOoohhhhh Mommeeeee!! It Huuuurrts!...” Paige howled, 
“Oowwww! ... OOOoooooowww!!! ...”
“Paige sweetie, you’re doing great!” her mother reassured her.
“OOhhhhhh God!! ... Not moving! ... Can’t do it! ... Hooohhhh!! ... 
Hooohhh!!” the girl gasped, her red and sweat streaked face taut with fear.
“Yes you can! You can do it, darling!” April urged, “When the next 
pain comes on I want you to push as hard as you can!”
“That’s what I’ve been doing Mommeeeeee!!” Paige blubbed. 
“Oohh Migod ... Oohh Migod ... here comes another one! ...”
April leant forward and grabbed her daughter’s slender, girlish legs 
and forced them out and wide into the splits. “Puuuush!! ... Puuuush!! ...” 
she shouted at her daughter.
“HHhhnnnnggghh!! ...” Paige moaned, her face screwing up and 
going purple with effort. “... OOooohhh God ... HHhhnnnnggghh!! ... “
“Breathe sweetie ...” April urged, “Deep breath ... then Puuuush!! 
...”
Excruciating pain burned through Paige’s body. She howled and 
squirmed, twisting her hips and flailing her legs, one banging on the 
dashboard, the other the other stubbing her toes on the roof.
“Mommeee!! It moved! ...” she wailed. “Ooohhh ... 
HHHHhhnnnnnggggghhhh!!! ...”
“Ohh Sweetie, its coming!!” April cried, and it was true, her 
daughter’s sweet little vulva had parted slightly, and between the soft lips 
was the white glistening shape of her baby’s head, covered in birthing goo.
“Breathe hard baby,” she instructed, “Deep breaths like you learnt. 
You’ve got to give a big push with the next one.”
The rain drummed on the roof. The windows of the vehicle were

heavy with fog. Puddles of birth fluid sloshed in the foot wells. Paige’s cries 
rang out, loud and harsh in the confined space. Her vulva became a tight 
bulging ring, about two inches in diameter April guessed, but that was not 
good enough, four would be required before the baby was out.
Paige collapsed again, panting desperately: “Whhhooooo ... 
Whhhooooo ... Not big enough! ... can’t do it! ...” she cried “... Ooohhhh! 
God! What can I do? ... Whhhooooo ... Whhhooooo ...”
“This is great!” her mother assured her, “Take it steadily, your body 
needs time to stretch and adjust. Now breathe!”
“OOoooowww ... HHHHhhnnnnnggggghhhh!!! ...” and again the 
young girl pushed with all her might.
April was astonished at the flexibility of young flesh. The head, 
which had slipped back, immediately thrust forward, straining her 
daughter’s modest opening to the full, but this time the flesh continued to 
stretch, to stretch impossibly to about three inches wide and curve outward 
around the huge battering ram punching through her maidenly tunnel. 
Paige’s eyes bulged wide with agony.
“AAAaaaeeeeeiiiiiii!!!...” she screeched. “It HUUUUUURTS ...!!!”
“STOP PUSHING! ... STOP PUSHING! ...” her mother screamed 
“Let it adjust!”
“Oohhhhh God, my pussy!! ...” Paige wailed. “Got to get it out! ... 
Hurts too much! ... Got to push!! ...”
April clapped her hand to her daughter’s delicate vulva, as she had 
seen the midwives do in the birth videos they had watched together, holding 
the baby in so that her daughter’s labia would have time to stretch the 
remaining inch that was needed without tearing.
“Oomigod what’s happening? ... Its going back in!! ...” sobbed the 
distraught teen. The head of her babe had retreated a little under the strong 
elasticity of her overstretched flesh and her mother’s firm hand but her gap 
was still distended by its wide, bony curve.
“One more, sweeting ...” April crooned, “One more good push and 
the baby will be here!”
“You stopped it coming! ...” wailed her traumatised daughter. “You 
evil bitch you pushed it back in!! ...”
“Oh Paige, I had to darling ...” April gulped, her heart torn by her 
daughter’s terrible ordeal.
“Mommmeeeee ...” Paige whimpered, “It’s coming again! ... I’ve 
got to push!! ... OOOOOOHH!!! NOOO!! My pusseeeEEEEE!!!! ...”
April winced as her young daughter threw her head forward, 
clutched her knees and bore down with her woman’s birthing instinct. Her 
vulva stretched slowly wider and wider, gradually folding out until it 
resembled a long, paper-thin tube of tight membrane drawn around the 
blessedly slimy bones of her baby’s skull.
“AAAAAaaaaaaaaaaeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiiii!!! ...” Paige gave a long-
drawn out howl of agony as the massive, sliding head squeezed out of the 
vice-like grip of her sheath, stabbing her with pain as every bump and notch

of her babe’s face and head gouged at her cruelly overstretched sex. Then: 
“UUuuuurrrrhghhhhhh ...” as the head popped out in a cascade of fluid and 
an audible snap of her young, elastic vulva.
“Oh God. You’ve done it Paige! You’ve done it!! ...” her mother 
babbled with joy and relief. Her elder child lay back panting with the shock 
and effort. The baby’s adorable little face was staring upwards in surprise 
from between Paige’s teenaged thighs.
Suddenly April felt something tighten and cramp within her. 
“NNnnnggghh! ..” she groaned with the pain. “OOoooohhhh! ...” and she 
leaned back grabbing at her loose and swollen tummy.
“Ohmigod Mommeee! ... What’s wrong!! ...” cried Paige anxiously, 
as her mother’s puffy, battered vulva began to ooze dark red clots of blood.
“OOoofffffff ...” April panted, squirming uncomfortably with her 
renewed contractions. “It’s the afterbirth, darling ... Oooohhhh! ... 
Hhhnngggghh!! ... Got to push! ...”
“Mommeeeeee!! ...” Paige wailed, “Help meeee!! ... It’s coming 
again! ... OOOooohhh!! ... HHHHhhnnnnnggggghhhh!!! ...” and both 
women were now straining their legs apart, thrusting their hips urgently 
forward towards each other.
“OOooooooowwwww!! ... “ Paige shrieked, “Oh God! ... 
HHHHhhnnnggghhhh!!! ... It’s not moving!! MommEEEEEEEE!! ... I need 
you! HELP MEEEEEE!! ...”
“Can’t right now, sweetie,” April gasped, reaching between her 
bloody thighs for the cord protruding from her gaping sex. Her womb was 
contracting sharply now and she could feel a squishy mass moving down her 
channel.
“Ooohhh Mommeeee!! Mommeeee!! ...” Paige was crying, her 
limbs flailing in panic as she found herself stuck with her baby’s head 
poking out of her tender vagina. Then “... OOOOoooooo!! ...” Her eyes 
bulged in shock as her mother’s entrance stretched out again and a heavy, 
round, veiny mass pushed out.
“Aaaahhh! ... Aaaaahhh!! ...” April gasped, stretching herself wide 
and tugging on the cord to draw her afterbirth clear.
“AAAHOOOOOOO!! ...” echoed Paige in astonishment, for the 
panic stricken twisting of her pelvis had released the shoulder of her baby 
and it now shot like a projectile out of her tight young vagina, splatting 
meatily into its half-siblings placenta which, at the same instant, plopped 
wetly from her mother’s rather looser sex.
At this unkind collision the new-born set up a lusty wail.
April put aside the red spongy mass which had nurtured her 
precious infant son, picked up her new grandchild, a girl, and handed her to 
Paige who was still puffing and blowing from the shock of delivery. She 
helped Paige lift her top and bare her swollen, jutting breasts, streaked 
beneath with the red stripy marks of motherhood. Two thick, crimson nipple 
stalks stood high on her chest, quiveringly erect, and April showed Paige 
how to bring the baby’s mouth to one of them. Paige gave a little mew of

pleasure as the baby instinctively turned and gulped the plump teat into her 
tiny mouth.
Reaching to the back seat, April was at last able to return her new 
son to her own much lower dangling breast, which was already dribbling 
milk from the arousing sight of her nursing daughter.
Paige cradled her baby above an abdomen which, resilient with 
youth, was already much flattened, even though she had yet to expel her 
afterbirth, while April rested her suckling son on her ageing belly, still 
round and swollen although softened now with the emptying of her womb. 
She wondered whether, at her age, she would ever again recover a proper 
flatness to her tummy.
For a time the two women sat, feeding their babes, nipples stiffened 
with pleasure by the softly sucking mouths, vaginas throbbing and sore from 
the cruel punishment they had endured.
“Mommy,” Paige puzzled at length. “Was this the consequence or 
the reward?”
“Both, I think, my darling,” was the reply.
