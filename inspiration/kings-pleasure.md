No Madame No!” her ladies in waiting cried, “You cannot! Not so 
late!”
“I must,” she replied in a passion. “I have no choice. Even now 
some young doxy will have his hands all over her. He ruts like a rabbit. I 
dare not leave him until after the baby!”
Yet she understood every reason for her ladies’ concern. For months 
she had appeared at the King’s side in ever wider-waisted gowns, ignoring 
the glances of the nobility scandalised at yet another mistress swelling with 
the King’s illegitimate child. Yet she could not retire to discreet seclusion as 
her predecessor had done. Not with her own example before her: she had, 
after all, finally enticed the King between her own eager thighs at a time 
when both her predecessor and the Queen were retired from court, great 
with child. 
But there was a limit to what any woman might get away with. The 
church taught that even a husband might not consort with his wife for the 
month before the expected onset of her pains; not for nothing was it termed 
her confinement. There was therefore not even any respectable dress for a 
woman once she became very big in the belly.
She had tried, truly she had tried. It was several weeks since she last 
dined with the King. Afterwards she had undressed and taken his member 
from behind on all fours on the bed, while he held and stroked her swollen, 
low hanging tummy. But, in the time since, she had been tortured by 
accounts of the court as it hunted at Fontainebleau, and which of the virginal 
maids were at the King’s side, and where on their lithe, slim bodies his 
hands had lingered.
‘A woman begins to lose her bloom at twenty-two’: that was the 
accepted wisdom. At twenty-eight, the Countess Françoise Athénaïs de 
Montespan was glamorous, accomplished, witty but aging and very, very 
pregnant. Now the King had returned to the Louvre. A noblewoman would 
be in his bed tonight, of that she was sure. As she was equally sure that it 
must be her.
Her women looked stricken as they helped her dress. The once 
shapely handfuls of her breasts were now tense and swollen and drooping 
under their extra weight. She bade her women put a binding over her 
chemise to lift and support them. Next the gown; the only one cut to 
accommodate her later pregnancy, green to compliment her eyes and richly 
embroidered with gold. The bodice was tugged tight over her raised breasts; 
the catches would not meet. Athénaïs grunted with discomfort as the bodice 
was gripped and fiercely pulled to, crushing her tender teats. Below the 
enormous, tightly stretched belly protruded far out from the gaping opening 
of the gown. 
With one lady at each edge of the gown they tugged it fiercely 
across her hard, round tummy. She cried out in pain as hands and elbows 
dug cruelly into the thin walls of her over-full womb. But in vain.
Finally: “Fasten it below,” she commanded. “Let my lord appreciate 
the lusty growth of the seed he has planted in me!”

There was a chorus of aghast cries. Several women burst into tears 
at the shame of their mistress appearing so. Hortense, oldest and most 
trusted among them looked painfully into her eyes.
“Do not do this, my mistress,” she pleaded, “It will be counted an 
outrage, a scandal. To be seen in public so late in your term, let alone in 
such a state of undress, it cannot be borne. The King must cut you dead. 
Please do not do it!”
Athénaïs was moved by the intense concern of her loyal friend. “Do 
not fret, good Hortense,” she murmured gently. “I risk all, but when have I 
not? And I know the King. This thing must be done, and I am equal to it.”
Hortense’s aging eyes welled with tears. “She is the bravest woman 
in France!” she sobbed.
“And the most foolish,” the scandalised eyes of the other women 
seemed to say.
She came upon the king in the royal stateroom. The immense 
paneled walls gleamed in the light from the chandeliers. In the corner 
several musicians were maintaining discreet background music. The 
courtiers lounged comfortably in ornately carved and upholstered chaises. 
The women wore exquisitely coloured silken gowns, bodices emphasising 
their narrow waists and the high apples of their breasts, sleeves and skirts 
luxuriant in pleats and ruffs; the men even gaudier with their heavily 
embroidered waistcoats and knee breaches. But none would be foolish 
enough to rival the King for opulence of attire. His majesty sparkled in 
crimson and gold, his waistcoat comfortably open to give room for his sated 
belly, an informality not permitted to anyone else in the room. 
But Athénaïs had eyes only for his companion, the fifteen-year-old 
Charlotte-Eléonore de la Motte Houdancourt. She perched on the arm of 
Louis’ chair, slender and fragile, the King’s arm around her resting on her 
thigh and her pale auburn hair tumbling over him as she leant forward 
giggling at an unheard remark. Athénaïs would not be supplanted by such as 
her!
The companionable hubbub in the room weakened and died as all 
eyes turned to the apparition at the door. There were gasps of horror as they 
saw her standing there. Athénaïs was elegantly tall with, normally, just a 
touch of shapeliness in her figure. As the years passed she could sometimes 
be thought of as having a somewhat pinched look to her narrow, bold 
features, but pregnancy had plumpened her face giving her a new 
youthfulness which survived, thanks to the cosmetic arts, the tiredness 
which was these days ever present. Her glossy black hair fell in copious 
ringlets to her bare shoulders.
Her bodice, cut fashionably low, strained to the utmost but could 
barely contain her heavily swollen bosom. Great plump mounds of lush, 
translucent flesh sprang out above the lacy top framing a long, deep 
cleavage, the broad expanse carpeted with a tracery of thick, blue veins 
attesting to the churning productivity developing within her breasts.

But most eyes were drawn, scandalised, below. Many had seen her 
green gown when, some weeks ago, it had tightly encased her shamefully 
rounded belly. Now, at the extremity of her gestation, a single catch, 
stressed to near breaking point, clasped it tautly to the upper slope of the 
huge globe of her womb, beneath, a similar catch, hidden in the low 
overhang, clutched it together again. Between, the gown gaped yawningly to 
show a broad expanse of white undergarment drawn skintight over her 
ripened mound, the stiff stalk of her outthrust navel poking shamelessly 
through the fabric.
The King’s voice cut through the deafening silence: “Well, my dear 
this is—unexpected,” he said, amused and calculating. “Shouldn’t a woman 
in your condition be in bed—resting?”
“I find my bed has been of late lonely and—unsatisfying,” she 
replied. There were suppressed gasps and then a deathly hush. Breaths were 
held.
The King chuckled softly, his cruel considered laugh, but the 
tension eased abruptly. Athénaïs, her eyes flashing, waddled carefully across 
the room towards the King, trying to ignore the incessant pressure deep 
within her tummy. A pointed glare at the confused Charlotte-Eléonore was 
sufficient to send the maiden scurrying. Another glance at one of the 
servants silently standing at the walls was sufficient to bring cushions for 
her to sit on at the King's side; she was much too far gone to contemplate 
sitting on a chair arm and, indeed, lowering herself to the floor was achieved 
only at the cost of an unbecoming flush of effort and with bare avoidance of 
a humiliating grunt of discomfort.
But the King was hers and with the combination of her conversation 
and the tantalising view down her cleavage she would keep him so for the 
evening. Remind him of why she was the one carrying his child.
As he laughed, more genuinely, at her witticisms he leaned towards 
her. “I like it in you, ma chère Athénaïs, that you keep me from boredom. I 
am so often bored these days.”
“Anything to please your majesty.”
“Anything?” he goaded, his cruel smile returning.
“I am at your command, always,” she lowered her immaculately 
coiffured head submissively.
He leaned closer: “Then there is a something you can do for me that 
no one else has,” he hissed.
“Name it, sire.”
“I would watch you in the process of birth, watch the baby emerge 
from between your glorious thighs.”
Athénaïs’s heart lurched and she looked quickly around to be sure 
that they had not been overheard. “Your wish is my command,” she 
responded uncertainly.
“It should be an easy enough time for you,” he continued 
sardonically, after all you have given two children to your late husband 
already.

Athénaïs simpered resentfully at that slur on the size of her cunny. It 
was, after all, narrow enough to have drawn a regular spend from the Royal 
prick and to have got her in her present condition, at least until now: she 
didn’t want to think about how stretched she might be after this, her third 
childbed.
The King leaned closer. “You mentioned the loneliness of your 
bed,” he whispered. “Is it then still possible for you to consummate the act 
of love?”
“As much as ever,” she breathed in reply.
“Then you have my permission to come to my bedchamber,” he 
said, eyes devouring her lush gravid curves.
Even knelt at the side of the King, Athénaïs found herself rapidly 
tiring and so she was glad when Louis made an early announcement of his 
intention to retire to bed. She clambered to her feet, her face turned from the 
room so that the courtiers would not see the strain on her face from the 
effort, but she was rewarded by the triumph of having them, one by one, 
take their leave of her: she sti

ll held the power of the King’s regard.

Late that night she padded awkwardly down the private corridor 
connecting her rooms to the bedchamber of the King. Candles provided 
a dim and flickering light in which Louis’ eyes gleamed as he followed her 
progress into the room. She undid the buttons which secured her tent-like 
retiring robe and stood only in her fine shift, her body clearly outlined 
beneath. Then she began to draw her shift up and up, baring the lushly 
rounded thighs, the outthrust belly and then lifting it high up to clear her 
head and leave her panting softly, naked before the King.
He saw before him a sight that was not meant for any man: the body 
of a woman on the verge of childbirth. Her breasts were enlarged and they 
hung long and plump and heavy on the firm shelf of her belly. The nipples, 
somewhat down-pointing, were thick and dark and protruded a finger nail’s 
length from her shockingly large areolae, equally dark and ragged at their 
edges where the colour seemed to bleed out into the pale flesh of her paps. 
But it was below where his eyes lingered, on the great, taut mass of her 
straining abdomen, distended by his child until her flesh seemed hard and 
almost ready to burst from the impossible size of her womb. Her navel was 
a stretched, hard lump and up the very centre of this enormous, thrusting 
boulder she was carrying ran a fat dark line from the shadow between her 
legs to her ribcage. His pecker stood fiercely.
Athénaïs came to the bed and turned back the covers, displaying the 
royal torso, flagstaff raised. With a subdued huff of effort she climbed onto 
the bed and straddled her lord. She knew she must control this encounter. 
Her tummy was now too huge and tight to risk other than a very careful 
bedding. So she rode the King, panting and perspiring as she forced her 
massively swollen abdomen up and down, up and down the King’s rigid 
organ. She leaned forward to support her weight on her hands, her breasts

swaying and wobbling before him with her movements, her nipples 
becoming longer and stiffer with her arousal. He reached up to grasp the 
ripe, chocolate fruit, cruelly pinching her delicate, sensitive nubbins and 
then kneading and milking the dense, tender glands behind them until little 
droplets sprang up on the ends of her aching, throbbing teats and glistened 
in the candle light. 
Athénaïs’s breathing was becoming ragged, her excitement 
overcoming her; it had been some time since her vagina had received a 
pleasuring and she could feel the familiar tension building in her tummy, so 
tightly stretched by her child. Her wet, sloppy sheath was sliding so easily 
now and she was puffing hard and moaning as she sought the extra 
swiftness and forcefulness she needed. But the King’s hands ravaging her 
breasts were breaking her control and sending hot waves of pressure down 
to her loins: pressure and more pressure until suddenly she cried out in 
surprise as a deep cramping gripped her, rippling around her tightly packed 
womb making it stand out, hard and sore, then clutching and shivering down 
her cunny. 
At Athénaïs’s passionate cry, Louis had the sudden and unique 
feeling of the sheath holding his prick clenching fiercely. He was thrust 
immediately over the edge and, with a great roar, he thrust upwards into 
Athénaïs’s hot cunny and unloaded a teeming flood of royal seed into his 
gravid mistress.
Panting hoarsely, Athénaïs rolled her ungainly body off the royal 
prick and thumped heavily on her back. Her hands cupped her aching belly 
where that awful pain was slowly ebbing. Her thickened thighs were 
splayed apart and it seemed that Louis had spent more copiously than usual 
as she felt thick globules ooze out of her plundered cunny and trickle down 
her bum crack to the waiting sheets. Even reclining, the pressure of her babe 
deep between her hips was intense.
Forcing herself to her feet she tugged her garments roughly about 
her swollen body and, ignored by her monarch who seemed to have fallen 
into a pleasured sleep, she waddled painfully back to her own bed,
Her dreams were troubled. Again and again she woke clutching with 
alarm at a stabbing, gripping pain in her distended abdomen.

By morning she knew herself to be suffering the early pangs of 
childbirth. She deeply regretted her actions of the night before which 
had brought this upon her. All the world must know that she had spread her 
legs in the royal bed last night and what fragment of reputation she had left 
could surely not survive the suspicion that the King had been sullied by 
lying with a parturient woman not only within a month of her confinement, 
as the church taught, but literally as her body began to push her babe into 
the world. She must pray that her pains would fade and allow a decent 
interval before the royal offspring emerged.

As they dressed her, she felt the eyes of her ladies appraisingly upon 
her. Her shift, sweat-dampened as a result of her disturbed sleep, was 
hurriedly cast aside with the broad stains, evidence of copious fluids seeped 
from her cunny, tactfully ignored. As the new shift was tugged down over 
the belly, huge, taut and low-hanging, she was seen to catch a sharp breath. 
She looked anxious and her hands flew to her straining womb.
“Madame ...” asked Anne-Lucie solicitously. “Is something 
wrong?”
“Not at all,” she managed to gasp. “Just the babe moving. It ... 
oohh ....”
She was unable to finish. The babe was moving true enough, but not 
quite in the way she implied.
She clung fiercely to her belly, the pain now become a fiery band 
tightening around her middle.
“Madame should return to bed,” Anne-Marie pronounced, to 
murmurs of assent, “The doctor should be summoned immediately!”
“No!” Athénaïs proclaimed anxiously. “It is nothing. See, already it 
passes!” She forced her hands away from her still painfully cramping 
mound. Forced herself to breath steadily. She held out her arms imperiously 
for her gown to be fitted, casting an appealing glance to Hortense. Her 
faithful friend immediately lifted the heavy fabric to her tense body, anxiety 
etched on her well loved face.
Anne-Lucie looked in mute appeal to the others. Several had 
calculating expressions on their faces. They understood the implications of 
their mistress’s clenching belly and were wondering how much longer 
loyalty to her would bring reward.
Athénaïs bit her lip and sweat started up on her furrowed brow, but 
she rode out the cramping of her womb until she could once again relax and 
move more easily. She observed that the others held back from supporting 
Anne-Lucie.
Athénaïs’ gown flowed loosely about her hugely swollen belly in 
shimmering folds of finest silk. She sat, her mind in turmoil, distractedly 
embroidering a tiny gown for the infant in her tummy. Her ladies, engaged 
in the same task, were subdued and watchful. There was a wariness in the 
air. Fortunately her gown hid from them how wide apart she held her thighs 
in response to the pressure she was feeling and how low her tight, straining 
belly pressed between them.
Every so often she sucked in a deep breath and schooled her face to 
calmness as a burning pain spread around the wide circumference of her 
tummy. She tried to tell herself that the pains were not coming more quickly, 
that the pressure in her loins was not increasing.
The morning passed. Her back was aching and she welcomed the 
opportunity to stand and move to the luncheon table.
“Aahh! ... Aahhh!” she gasped as she struggled to her feet. Her legs 
felt strangely insecure as though something was pressing its way between 
them. She was between pains but she could not hold her legs together and

the pressure of the fetus on her unsupported bottom was distracting. It was 
grown much stronger since she had sat. 
Her women crowded around her sympathetically, offering arms in 
support. She could waddle the short distance to the table without trouble.
But then she was conscious of an aching cramp building in her 
back. Surely it was too early to be another pain? 
“Whoo ... Whoo ...” she puffed. But it was spreading around her 
sides and flaring into that familiar burning feeling ...
“Nooo! Not so soon! ...” she realised she had said it aloud! She was 
nearly at the table; but this one was coming so fast and so hard! Suddenly 
she was staggering the last steps and bending at the waist, one hand gripping 
the table edge, the other clutching the gown to the under-swell of her belly. 
Her head dipped, her curls tumbling hiding her face which was screwing up 
in pain.
“AAAaaawwwwwwngggg!! ...” she moaned. Her fierce wail rang 
about a room in which all chatter had suddenly stopped. Her women were 
looking at her with varying expressions: shock, horror, concern, calculation. 
For all recognised the hard, groaning cry that comes from deep within, 
unique to a woman gripped by the agonies of childbirth.
“Hhhaaagghh! ... Hhhaaagghh! ...” she panted hoarsely, trying to 
recover her composure. Her condition was now too patent to be denied. But 
it might be many hours yet, even days before her child finally squeezed into 
the world. Her remaining chance was to persuade her ladies to secrecy. She 
looked wildly around the room, but Anne-Marie was already gone.
Athénaïs was seated at the table, still breathing heavily. A group of 
her women clustered about her fanning her face with lacy handkerchiefs or 
rubbing her arm soothingly. Another group had withdrawn to the corner of 
the room as if dissociating from her in her extremity. She determined that 
she would see that they suffered. 
Two attendants entered, Anne-Marie beaming triumphantly behiind 
them.
“You must accompany the servants,” she said, “The King requires 
it!”
In a daze Athénaïs got clumsily to her feet. There was something 
she had said last night that whispered at the back of her mind, Something 
she had agreed to.

The attendants led her away from her rooms, down corridors which led 
to another part of the palace altogether. This was not where she had 
planned to be delivered of the King’s child. Servants and minor 
functionaries bustled to and fro averting their eyes from the puffing, 
waddling woman. Once she had to stop, doubling over and clutching at her 
sharply contracting abdomen. She felt humiliated that she should be seen in 
such a delicate state by such people.

Finally they entered a large paneled room. It contained a large bed, 
a sideboard, and a chamber pot in one corner. The room was brightly lit by 
two huge chandeliers. Along one wall was hung a massive tapestry. Gazing 
in astonishment she could see holes in it through which darkness was visible 
beyond, just like peep holes. She remembered now what it was she had 
agreed to. But she had thought to be on shameful show for the King’s eyes 
only. It was obvious from the size and number of the holes in the tapestry 
that it was designed to accommodate more than one set of eyes. Many more 
than one set. She realised with angry embarrassment that she was to be 
humiliated in front of half the court.
The attendants helped her out of her robe, then bent and began 
lifting her shift up her legs.
“No!” she cried with alarm.
“It is the King’s instruction, Madame,” they replied impassively.
“Not yet,” she pleaded, “Not before the doctor ... uunnngghhhh!!” 
She clutched at the nearest of the two attendants for support as she hunched 
over her cramping belly. The pains were coming so strongly now. 
“HHhhooooooo! ... HHhhooooooo! ...” she panted frantically. She 
straightened painfully, sweat already heavy on her brow. She must look a 
fright she thought distractedly. She staggered to the bed and gripped the 
bedpost with both hands, slumping against it. 
The attendants followed and swiftly stripped the shift up over her 
lush, mature thighs, baring the thick, copious growth foresting her mound 
and straggling up the slope of her protruding belly. The belly itself was a 
huge globe, low hanging and tightly stretched so that the straining flesh was 
shiny and gleaming in the light of the multitude of candles. 
“Noooo!!” she moaned, but she had no strength to fight, or even to 
take her hands from the bedpost. The attendants tugged the shift up her back 
and over her head and she had no choice but to stand defiantly as they took 
it from her unresisting arms. She could imagine the glittering, lascivious 
gaze of the King and courtiers as they gazed on her plundered charms. 
Choked with fury she lumbered awkwardly towards the tapestry. Let them 
see in closest detail the body which carried the royal child. Let them ... Oh 
no! It was coming again!
“OOhhhhhnngggg!! ...” she groaned, her eyes going wide with 
shock.
Oh dear God this was a hard one, the worst yet. She longed to reach 
for the tapestry, to tear it from the wall and expose the audience ogling her 
so lewdly, but she was rooted to the spot, legs parted and knees wobbling 
wider from the awful pressure.
“UUUUuunnnnngggggghhh!! ...” she wailed, both hands clapped to 
the great round bowl of her belly. Right in front of them, so close they could 
see every ripple of her tautly stretched tummy as it clenched and stood out, 
hard and low, so close they could see the first spurts trickle out of her bush 
and run, glistening down her thighs.

A a a a a a g g g h h h h ! ! . . . H h o o o ! . . . H h o o o ! . . . 
UUUUuunnnnngggggghhh!! ...” she wailed again, spreading her thighs and 
sending the contents of her baby’s torn bag splashing to the polished floor 
between them.
Behind the curtain, half a dozen avid pairs of male eyes drank in the 
shockingly distended body of the famous beauty displayed so wantonly 
before them. The pain and distress plain in that arrogant face sent audible 
frissons of excitement through the watchers. Hands pressed into breeches 
and found stiffened peckers. Then gasps as she spread those Junoesque 
thighs. So close did they bend to those holes in the tapestry that the gushing 
waterfall, when it came seemed as if it would splash into their very eyes. 
With cries of alarm they reeled back then fell into fevered whispers. One or 
two had just experienced their first spend of the show.
For some time she lay sprawled on the bed to which she had 
staggered with the help of the attendants for her limp, ungainly body. They 
had spread her legs and wiped away the messy, bloody fluids which had 
gushed from her maternal gash, leaving her hairy lips gaping a little, tender 
and inflamed.
The doctor finally came to examine her. With a sign to the 
attendants he had them pull her into sitting position on the side of the bed. 
He firstly probed with his hands her huge, tight belly.
“Hmmf,” he said. “It’s certainly a big one this time. You have some 
work ahead of you Madame!”
Next he pushed her thighs apart and dove two thick fingers into her 
throbbing tunnel. Athénaïs winced with pain at the rude invasion.
“You don’t want to worry about a couple of little fingers,” he 
cackled. “You’ll have something a lot bigger than these stretching you out 
before too very long!”
Athénaïs fixed him with a steely glare. How dare he humiliate her 
so in front of not only the attendants but the assembled watchers of whom 
he couldn’t be ignorant. But just then his probing seemed to trigger 
something inside her and she was seized with a greater pain, a very 
profoundly greater pain. She doubled over clutching at her belly, his fingers 
still buried within her squeezing vagina.
“HHhhhhaaaaaaggghh! ...” she groaned, “HHhhooooo!! ... 
HHhhooooo!! ...” as her tummy became a hard fiery sheet clamping down 
on the baby within.
The doctor hastily tugged his fingers free. “Walking!” he 
commanded the attendants. “Get her up and walking!”

For many hours Athénaïs plodded the room. The attendants had taken 
pity on her and thrown a drape across her bowed, exhausted shoulders, 
but it did not come near covering her distended, low-hanging belly. She 
tried to be proud and brave in front of the unseen watchers whose eyes 
occasionally glinted from behind the tapestry hanging but her pains were

coming more and more frequently, forcing her to cry out and buckle, 
clawing at her convulsing uterus and sagging in the arms of the attendants 
as her knees spread uncontrollably in response to the heavy pressure 
building between them. Each time her pants and moans grew a little stronger 
and she needed to spend longer gasping for breath supported by the 
attendants before she could pull herself wearily upright and waddle 
awkwardly forward once again.
The day had waned in the room beyond the tapestry. Watchers had 
come and gone, spending some time gloating or marveling over the tortured 
form of the King’s mistress, then leaving to attend to other business. The 
court had repaired for an early dinner, so as not to miss the evening’s 
entertainment, and servants were set to spy upon the agonies of Athénaïs’ 
labour and report progress to the King.
Now, replete from his repast, the King led the favoured courtiers 
back to the room beyond which the Countess was now into her tenth hour of 
labour. Her urgent cries carried into the viewing room as the King settled 
down with a grunt of satisfaction to resume his watch. The doctor had 
assured him that the moment of crisis was approaching.
Her pains were coming hard and often now and she could feel the 
cruel cannonball which was her baby’s head grinding lower and lower into 
the bones of her hips. Her knees were wobbling wider apart she was feeling 
a fierce searing urgency between her hips.
“It’s time!” she gasped. “The baby is coming! I need the chair!”
Wildly she looked about the room, registering for the first time the 
absence of the birthing chair: the chair in which she would sit in order to 
bear down and force the baby those last terrible inches through her womanly 
passage.
“Oh Lord!” she gasped. “Hurry, I’m ready for the chair!” Surely 
they couldn’t be intending her to sit on the edge of the bed, she thought in 
panic, with nothing for her back and arms to hold and push against?
“No chair,” said the chief attendant firmly as they tugged her 
towards the bed.
“No chair?” she cried.
“Monsieur the King’s orders.”
Athénaïs was bewildered and cast a beseeching gaze at the tapestry.
The attendants pushed her onto the large bed, Athénaïs huffing and 
gasping with the effort of hauling her sore, swollen body on hands and 
knees onto the lavishly embroidered counterpane.
“AAaaaaaaiiiiiiiiiii!! ...” she wailed as the twisting of her body 
compressed her enormous tummy and set off a savage, cramping 
contraction. “HHHoooooo!! ... HHHoooooo!! ...” she panted, sweat pouring 
into her eyes from her fevered forehead. She knew her lush, rounded rump 
was quivering lewdly in the air before the avid gazes of the onlookers, her 
thick, hairy vulva perhaps already beginning to push open with the urgency 
of her contraction, but she could do nothing other than bury her head in the 
bed and moan with pain, her low hanging belly tight as a drum as she

pushed and pushed, willing her child to move down her tunnel, to cease 
stretching the tenderest parts of her sexual organ.
So oblivious was she in her desperation that she barely noticed the 
attendants push her over. Suddenly she was on her side, and then rolled, 
with considerable effort on behalf of the attendants, onto her back.
Agony crashed through her body.
“HHHHAAAAAAAEEEEEEEEIIIIII!! ...” she screamed, as 
suddenly the cramping of her belly muscles forced her babe not down her 
waiting channel but back against her spine. Her legs kicked desperately in 
the air trying to ease the pain caused by her birth canal being bent at such an 
awkward angle upwards, closing her child’s route to the outside world.
Frantically she struggled, twisting and bucking, trying to turn her 
ungainly body over into a position from which she could resume her urgent 
pushing.
The attendants grabbed her arms, twisting them cruelly and forcing 
her to remain on her back.
“We will need to tie her,” the chief one muttered.
“Noooooo! ...” Athénaïs howled. “… For the pity of God, noooo! 
Let me up. The baby can’t come like this! … My Lord!” she cried out in the 
general direction of the tapestry. “You imperil the baby! I can’t push it out 
like this!”
There was no reply. Grimly the attendants tied her arms and legs to 
the four posts of the bed, spreading her wide so that the best possible view 
was afforded the holes in the screen.
In the room beyond, the King bent forward, a wolfish smile on his 
face. In this position he could look directly down the velvet sheath of his 
mistress as it stretched to accommodate his child.
Athénaïs’ tortured body gleamed with sweat in the flickering 
evening candlelight as she squirmed and strained against her bounds. In 
moments an awful contraction seized her belly, brought on by her desperate 
struggle.
“HhhhaaaaaaiiieeEEE!! …” she screamed. She pulled her knees up 
towards her burning tummy as far as she was able and simultaneously 
dragged ferociously down on the bonds holding her wrists above her head. 
The force of her efforts was transmitted to her huge labouring abdomen 
making her womb stand up, high and hard. Her belly was a sheet of pain, 
her face was twisted in agony, the tendons in her neck standing out like 
straining ropes. On either side of her glistening torso hung her plump, blue-
veined breasts, their fattened nipples standing up dark and long as result of 
her terrible exertions.
“AAAaaaaeeEEEEEIIIII!! …” she howled. Something was moving! 
Creeping down her constricted tunnel, but the effort it was costing her was 
insupportable. 
“HHhhhuuuuunnngggg …” she groaned. “HHhhhoooofffff!! … 
Ohh Lord! … HHhhhoooofffff!! … HHhhhoooofffff!! …” and she was

spent, slumping, gasping for breath, her sweat-drenched hair plastered 
wildly to her overheated body.
The intensity of the famous courtesan’s struggles, the pain etched on 
her still beautiful face and echoing around the room in her cries had 
stiffened the courtiers manhoods; however some of the selected women 
present were gasping queasily at the torture a woman must feel forced onto 
her back for the critical moments of delivery; the time at which she most 
needs the natural help of gravity to work her large burden through the 
narrow gate between her thighs.
The cadence of Athénaïs’ panting rose again. Again she twisted her 
hands in her bonds, seeking maximum grip for the agonising trial ahead. 
Her muscles rippled and contracted she took a deep rasping breath and then 
spread and pushed, a guttural groan bouncing eerily about the room as she 
pushed and pushed, almost lifting her body off the bed with the impossible 
effort.
Excited gasps sprang up among the courtiers as they leaned eagerly 
towards the tapestry. The lushly furred gash of the court beauty was bulging 
outwards! The round outline of something shockingly large could be 
discerned pushing at her womanly slit!
“AAaaaaaaeeeiiiiii!! …” Athénaïs gave a long keening cry. The 
despairing wail of a defeated woman. “I can’t! … I can’t! … Too big! … 
Too hard! …” she sobbed.
How had it come to this, she thought wildly? How could she, the 
most powerful woman in the land, after the Queen, the woman bearing the 
King’s child, be straining impossibly and alone before the gaze of her 
enemies at court to birth in such an unnatural position?
The humiliation and defeat of the arrogant royal mistress drove the 
eager courtiers to yet greater heights of excitement. Wads of thick creamy 
spend were gushing from fevered pricks, hands were groping boldly up the 
dresses of any nearby woman.
The King looked around. Ah, there she was: the pale slender beauty 
Charlotte-Eléanore. Her eyes were wide with shock, her lips parted. 
Reaching over, Louis drew her to his side. “Is it not a stimulating sight ma 
chèrie,” he murmured. “The miracle of life! The task of every loyal woman 
to bear offspring to her lord!”
Charlotte-Eléonore’s heart was beating furiously. She saw the 
terrible ravages pregnancy had wrought on the mature body of Athénaïs; the 
unbearable agonies with which her body was wracked in the attempt to be 
delivered of her child. She shuddered at the thought that one day this would 
be her fate also.
Athénaïs was in a fog of pain She knew in her heart that she could 
not produce her child in this terrible position, but she was allowed no 
choice; her pains gripped her violently, relentlessly and she could only push, 
haul against her bonds with every ounce of her strength and push.
Her bones were stretched and creaking now, she could feel the huge 
cannonball of her babe’s massive head battering cruelly at the delicate

membranes of her bottom. She cried and pushed and pushed and screamed 
with the searing pain in her distended womanhood.
The assembled courtiers could now clearly see the big bony outline 
of her baby’s head sending her bottom bulging out between her gaping 
thighs. Her gash, which seemed not properly aligned with the path the child 
was taking to the outside world, was nevertheless spreading slowly open, 
assuming first a teardrop shape, and then something even rounder; the skin 
becoming so thinly stretched it was bloodless and shiny.
Hands were now buried recklessly in furry grooves, the women’s 
eyes were glazing over as the smell of male semen began them oozing 
hormone-charged lubricant over the invading fingers.
The tired, gasping cries of the woman writhing on the bed were 
beginning to be matched by the urgent gasps of the aroused onlookers.
Athénaïs was moaning with agony, she was sure she must split open 
with the pressure now assailing her with every cruel contraction. This child 
felt so much larger than her previous births, or was it just the terrible 
position?
“HHhhhooooo!! … HHhhhooooo!! …” she gasped urgently sucking 
air into her lungs and trying desperately to take pressure off her ravaged 
tissues. The doctor had finally returned to the room, she noticed, carrying a 
tray of evil looking implements which he put on the sideboard. “Well, at 
least the King’s child will be preserved even if I have to ripped apart to 
achieve it!” she thought.
“HHhhhaauuuuuunnnngggggghhhh!! …” she groaned, as the next 
pain hit her and she clenched her muscles anew. She could feel her 
womanhood stretching; she could feel painful little tears as her muscles 
controlling her lower orifices reached the point of no return and broke apart. 
She felt herself opening wider, her unsupported cunny lips beginning to 
burn and sting.
From his vantage point looking straight down his mistress’s 
widespread thighs, King Louis watched as the plump, hairy lips so familiar 
to him, stretched out thinner and thinner until at last they formed a hard, 
tight O, and framed in that O was a slick bony plate which he knew must be 
the head of his child. The harsh screams of his mistress as her body began to 
split open with the results of the breeding given her 9 months before made 
his pecker swell and throb.
Charlotte-Eléanore gazed in astonishment as the king pulled open 
his breaches and tugged forth the big, knobbly royal weapon. He put out a 
strong male arm and pulled the uncomprehending girl against him. She 
stumbled and found herself astride his knees. Suddenly she understood.
Rough male hands lifted her skirts up her smooth slender legs.
“No! My lord, no!” she gasped. “I am pure! Please my lord, NO!”
Her mind was in turmoil. The tortured, gasping cries of the woman 
in crisis on the bed were a terrible reminder of the costs of being invaded by 
the organ which now threatened her. Soon his hands would be at her delicate

untouched crevice. Surely he didn’t mean to shred her precious young 
maidenhead!
Athénaïs’ plump limbs were now bucking and snapping at their 
restraints as she writhed and twisted in her efforts to free the huge body of 
her child from her terribly stretched cunny. Her howls of agony echoed 
heartrendingly about the chamber. The doctor approached the bed with a 
pair of large gleaming forceps in his hands.
“NOOOOOOOO!! …” screamed the labouring woman, and she 
screwed her face up and pushed with every ounce of energy in her body, 
with every muscle fibre that would still obey her exhausted brain.
“NOOOOOOOO!! …” echoed Charlotte-Eléanore from behind the 
tapestry as the terrified girl felt her petite, lightly-furred furrow pushed open 
by the wide, rubbery bulb which was the head of her monarch’s breeding 
wand.
Athénaïs screamed, sucked in a ragged breath and screamed again. 
It seemed impossible that she wasn’t splitting apart, so fiery was the pain in 
her ravaged labia, so big was the solid unforgiving girth of her baby. But bit 
by bit the bones of her baby’s skull were sliding painfully through, and 
suddenly its entire head popped out amid a fountain of hot bloody fluid 
which splashed and spurted down the doctor’s gown, to his intense horror.
No such relief was vouchsafed Charlotte-Eléanore as her sweet 
virginal cunny was simultaneously and irrevocably torn open and stretched 
by the king’s thick manhood.
Athénaïs had collapsed, panting and gasping, on the bed. Her child’s 
head protruded from her gaping vagina but the rest remained inside, there 
being no gravitational pull to slip it from her traumatised body. Slowly she 
realised she had yet more work to do. A need to summon the energy to drive 
her child’s body fully out between her legs.
She gasped, a wheezing terrible breath, screwed up her face, 
stretched her knees as wide apart as possible and began to push anew.
Behind the tapestry, appalled women had straddled their men, 
pumping their vaginas up and down rampant pricks in an effort to shut out 
the terrible torture being visited on the king’s mistress; but Charlotte-
Eléanore was sobbing softly as her sensitive young sheath learned to 
accommodate the girth of a mature man on the cruelly swollen weapon of 
the king. She imagined herself scorned and shamed as her tummy began to 
push unmistakably out beneath her virginal gowns; she saw herself alone 
and shunned in a nunnery, her belly huge and swollen with a bastard child; 
and she saw herself screaming in agony like the slut in the next room as her 
baby was torn from her ravaged body. 
Athénaïs writhed and rolled her hips crying out with effort. Her 
knees were aching from being held so far apart. “Get it out! … Get it OUT!! 
…” she screamed. One of the attendants took pity on her, seeing that the 
doctor was still preoccupied with getting her birth fluids off his gown, and 
knelt between her thighs.

“AAAAuuuuugggghhhhhh …” Athénaïs ground out, feeling herself 
pulled impossibly wide as the attendant tugged roughly at her baby’s head. 
For a moment there was a little tug of war as Athénaïs’s tortured labia 
fought to hold the baby and then she gave a shriek as the resistance gave 
way and the whole long slippery body of the King’s lusty son slid free.
At that very moment the King gasped and drove triumphantly 
upwards into the slender, fertile body of the deflowered Charlotte-Eléanore. 
She felt a hot copious wetness spread through her loins. She had been 
seeded—and a new fashion in childbirth had been established.
